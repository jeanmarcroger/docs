2. Chose a yVault and define how many tokens to deposit.
3. Approve the contract through the UI of your wallet.
4. Confirm the deposit transaction which will include the total amount of tokens you will deposit.
5. Check that transaction is successful.
6. Sit, relax, and let the ROI bring your passive income in.

## Let's breakdown the above steps.

### 1. You need to have in your wallet at least one of the tokens required by any of the yVaults.

Let's take the curve.fi/y LP yVault as depositing into this highly performant vault is a multi step process and covers simpler cases.

**First: On-ramp!**

On-ramp means, going from Fiat into crypto. For this you have a few options:

* Most likely will need a OTC \(over the counter\) exchange, basically a centralized exchange. Coingeko offers a [good up-to-date list](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges) of posibilities.
* Certain wallets offer easy ETH purchase through partners. Torus offers purchase of ETH from Moonpay, Wyre, Ramp, etc. Brave browser's wallet and Metamask do offer similar posibilities through differen partners. Check your preferred wallet!

**Second: Obtaining yCRV LP tokens**

What need to do is to:

* Deposit stable coins \(DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD\) into a the [Y Curve liquidity pool](https://www.curve.fi/iearn/), which in exchange sends to your wallet a token that represents your deposit.
* You will receive in return an amount of yDAI/yUSDC/yUSDT/yTUSD tokens into your wallet \(you might need to add this custom token into your wallet\).

There is one extra step that you might have realized is missing. In the [FIRST](https://docs.yearn.finance/how-to-guides/how-to-participate-in-a-yvault#1-you-need-to-have-in-your-wallet-at-least-one-of-the-tokens-required-by-any-of-the-yvaults) step, you got ETH on your wallet, but now you need one of the above stable coins as input for the Liquidity Pool. You can get this stable coins in many different ways

* CEX \([Centralized Exchanges\)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges)\)
* DEXs \([Decentralized Exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized)\) and DEX aggregators such as [1inch.exchange ](https://1inch.exchange/)
* By providing collateral and borrowing a stable coin such as DAI through [MakerDAOs Oasis App](https://oasis.app/borrow) or [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/) which aggregates features from several Defi apps and allows you to get DAI from a collateral such as ETH.

Let's recap, by now you should have gotten some ETH, exchanged it for some stable coins such as DAI and have deposited these stable coins into the Curve.fi Y Liquidity Pool. In your wallet you should have some tokens named "yDAI/yUSDC/yUSDT/yTUSD".

**THIRD: Deposit your LP tokens into yVault**

So finally, you need to go to [https://yearn.finance/vaults](https://yearn.finance/vaults) and click in the yVault called "curve.fi/y LP" ![](https://i.imgur.com/tUl511S.png)

* You will need to connect your wallet for this to be shown.
* From the left side, you can chose which percentage of your yCRV tokens available in your wallet you want to deposit in the yVault

* Once you've decided the quantity to deposit, click on deposit button. Your wallet will request you permission to "talk to the smart contract" and then it will request you to "confirm" the transaction.
* After succesful transaction you will see your yCRV \(LP tokens from the Y CRV liquidity Pool\) as deposited
